# XML
### Override XML Template
You can always override XML record by following this example :

```xml
<template id="product.report_productlabel" />
```

Inside your module, declare a line like the snippet above. it will monkeypatch `product.report_productlabel` inside the Odoo.

### Differentiate the view for HTML or Non HTML (WHKTMLTOPDF)
In case if you are developing a view that you wish to render to html or WKHTMLTOPDF you can use this
```xml
<div t-attf-class="#{'col-md-6 ml-auto' if report_type != 'html' else 'col-sm-7 col-md-6'}" style="width: 50%;">
    <!-- ... rest of your code ... -->
</div>
```

# Python
### Add New Selection Options
You can add new option into Odoo's fields.Selection(selection_add=[]) like :

```python
print_format = fields.Selection(selection_add=[
    ('zpl', 'ZPL Labels'),
    ('zplxprice', 'ZPL Labels with price')]
, ondelete={'zpl': 'set default', 'zplxprice': 'set default'})
```
If the print_format is defined somewhere in other module, you can just _inherit that module and make extension of the selection with the block above. it works.

### Create Access Token For A Record
Access token will mostly be used to access certain record, basically to let external user to see a record through certain page (like invoice).
In order to let your record has access token, you should make inheritance to your module like this example :

```python
_inherit = ['portal.mixin', 'mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin', 'sequence.mixin']
    
access_token = fields.Char()
```
Everything should have been exactly like example above, so it will allows you to make an access token.

### Compare / Convert The Database Time (UTC0) With Logged in User Timezone
By default, time and date inside Odoo postgresql is saved in UTC0 format. If you are working with times in Odoo, it is always recommended to convert the date and times into user's timezone first.
After you made some manipulation on those times in computer memory, simply save it back into fields.Datetime(). it will also converted back automatically into the UTC0 as well.

The recommended flow to work on the date in a nutshell is :
fetch a date from postgresql (use ORM is also fine) -> convert the date into current user timezone -> make some manipulation -> store it back to fields.Datetime() -> it will saved back into postgresql

This is the block example : 

```python
from odoo import fields

# Initializing the records and user timezones
api_time = record['updatedAt'] # Assuming this is the date and time, fetch from external API or casual text format
api_time_in_datetime_format = fields.Datetime.from_string(api_time) # Convert api_time into Datetime format using odoo fields import
user_timezone = self.env.user.tz # This will get current user timezone, accessible from .env

# convert from UTC0 (server timezone) to user timezone
api_time_in_user_timezone = fields.Datetime.context_timestamp(self.with_context(tz=user_timezone), timestamp=api_time_in_datetime_format)
api_time_converted_as_strftime= api_time_in_user_timezone.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
api_time_converted_as_strptime = datetime.strptime(api_time_converted_as_string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```
